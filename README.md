## Features
The toolset boasts of:
- An Energy Budgeter
- A Habit Tracker
- A Solar Suitability Check
- A Best of X Checker (Currently has one use case: Cars!)

## How we built it
We were both new to Streamlit, it was fun to explore! We were both surprised by how easy it was to get a GUI up and running for Python applications. We used Google Sheets to store the datasets that we used.
We also used GitHub to track our progress. Apart from storing the app's code on GitHub, we used Issues, Branches, Labels, and Project Boards - we even hosted our deployed app there, in conjunction with Streamlit! It was a wonderful experience.

## Challenges faced
Surprisingly, we were able to pace ourselves for the most part - sadly, one of our teammates had to drop, so the last few hours were a haze. Some of our biggest scares were brought up in the final stage - deployment. Even so, we had a blast!
